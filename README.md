# cf-worker-ip-redirect
Cloudflare Worker that redirects you to another website if your IP doesn't match one found in a KV Store

We use this so that employees in company offices and on VPN can access brand new domains before they're launched to the public, while the public is redirected to another public web site.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. A KV Namespace with unique IPs per line in CSV format:

ipAddress1,ipAddress1
ipAddress2,ipAddress2
ipAddress3,ipAddress3
...

2. A KV Namespace Binding with:

Variable Name = "ALLOWED_IPS"
KV namespace = "<whatever you named your namespace from Step 1 above>"

3. Edit line 17 of ip_redirect.js with the URL you want the public to be redirected to

4. (OPTIONAL) If using "deploy_worker.sh" to publish the script to your Cloudflare account, enter the KV Namespace ID on line 7 of "metadata.json" first.
